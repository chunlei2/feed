# Project Overview

Open the html will run the application.

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## First, make sure all the feeds are defined, including name and url.

## Second, make sure the menu is hidden by default and the menu changes visibility by clicking

## Third, make sure there is initial entry when we load the first feed

## Fourth, make sure the content changes after we load the second feed
